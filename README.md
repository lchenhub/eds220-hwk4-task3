# HW 4-Task 3 (Air Quality Index Data + False color image)

## Purpose
In this repo, there is a notebook in which we use Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the US Environmental Protection Agency to visualize the impact on the AQI of the 2017 Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County. We also will create a false color image showing the fire scar of the Thomas fire in 2017.
